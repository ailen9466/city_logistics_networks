# city_logistics_networks
This project contains the code and network data for the paper "Community structure and resilience of the city logistics networks in China". The explanation for the code part is for the community detection algorithm, specifically the myfun_algo_city_cluster function in community_detection_algo.py (with other functions serving auxiliary roles). For network resilience, one should run the corresponding functions in Fig_resilience.py.

It's worth noting that since the data cannot be directly published online, users will need to contact the authors or create their own city adjacency relationship table.

Additionally, the network needs to be converted into an input format (a few Series) that the function can accept before execution.
